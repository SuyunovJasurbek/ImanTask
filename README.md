# ImanTask
 While implementing this project, I mainly used time functions and used Cookie to store the token in the middleware.

 # How to run
    1. Clone the repository
    2. cd ImanTaskSumDays
    3. make run

# Working with the API
# Use Postman : 
# Token get 
## POST method: http://localhost:8080/gettoken

# Days get
## POST method: http://localhost:8080/getdays
